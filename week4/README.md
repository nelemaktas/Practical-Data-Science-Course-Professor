# Week 4: Data Visualization I – Telling Stories with Plotly

## 📚 Overview

This week you'll learn how to visualize data and communicate insights using Plotly, a powerful Python library for interactive charts. You'll explore how to turn raw data into compelling visual stories that highlight trends, patterns, and relationships.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Create basic and advanced plots with Plotly (scatter, bar, line, etc.)
- Customize visualizations (colors, labels, legends, layouts)
- Build interactive charts for data exploration
- Use Plotly to tell a story with data
- Apply visualization best practices for clarity and impact

## 🏗️ Mini-Deliverable

**Assignment:** Create a notebook that visualizes a real-world dataset using at least three different Plotly chart types. Your notebook should tell a clear story about the data, using interactive features and thoughtful design.

**Requirements:**
1. **Load a dataset** relevant to social impact or public policy
2. **Create at least three Plotly visualizations** (scatter, bar, line, etc.)
3. **Customize your charts** for clarity and engagement
4. **Add interactivity** (hover, zoom, filter)
5. **Explain your visualizations** and the story they tell
