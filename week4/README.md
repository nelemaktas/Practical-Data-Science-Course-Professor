# Week 4: Data Visualization I – Telling Stories with Plotly

## 📚 Overview

This week you'll learn how to visualize data and communicate insights using Plotly, a powerful Python library for interactive charts. You'll explore how to turn raw data into compelling visual stories that highlight trends, patterns, and relationships.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Create basic and advanced plots with Plotly (scatter, bar, line, etc.)
- Customize visualizations (colors, labels, legends, layouts)
- Build interactive charts for data exploration
- Use Plotly to tell a story with data
- Apply visualization best practices for clarity and impact

- Tutorial: [Data Visualization I: Plotly Basics](notebooks/tutorial_plotly_basics.ipynb)

## 🏗️ Mini-Deliverable

**Assignment:** Create your own analysis of the global temperature dataset using at least three different Plotly chart types. Your notebook should reveal patterns, trends, and insights about global temperatures over time.

**Dataset:** Average Monthly Surface Temperature (`data/average-monthly-surface-temperature.csv`)

**Requirements:**
1. **Explore the temperature dataset** - Load and examine the data
2. **Create at least three different visualizations** using different chart types (bar, line, scatter, box plots, etc.)
3. **Customize your charts** with meaningful titles, labels, colors, and legends
4. **Add interactivity** - Use hover information, zooming, or filtering features
5. **Interpret your findings** - Write markdown cells explaining what patterns you discovered and what they reveal

**Suggested Analyses:**
- Compare average temperatures across different countries or regions
- Track how temperatures have changed over specific time periods
- Identify seasonal patterns in temperature data
- Compare temperature ranges (min/max variations) across locations
- Analyze temperature trends across decades
